# smart-loan-recovery-system
Loan defaults pose a significant challenge for financial institutions by affecting profitability and cash flow. Using historical loan repayment data, borrower profiles, and payment behaviours, many financial companies now use a smart loan recovery system to optimize collection efforts, minimize recovery costs, and maximize loan repayments. 

To build a loan recovery system with Machine Learning, we will use a dataset containing borrower profiles, loan details, and repayment histories. This dataset includes critical attributes such as:

-Demographic Information: Age, employment type, income level, and number of dependents.
-Loan Details: Loan amount, tenure, interest rate, and collateral value.
-Repayment History: Number of missed payments, days past due, and monthly EMI payments.
-Collection Efforts: Collection methods used, number of recovery attempts, and legal actions taken.
-Loan Recovery Status: Whether the loan was fully recovered, partially recovered, or remains outstanding.
